## Hi there 👋
I'm Poorav — a software engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable distributed systems.

💻 I’ve worked at Oracle Cloud, where I built Java-based services focused on resiliency and failure attribution in cloud-native environment. I also interned at Kaspar Companies, developing an end-to-end Python application that automated credit-application workflows and eliminated 11+ hours of manual work every month.

🌱 I’m currently building a production-grade DocuChat application that lets you talk to your documents, with the goal of deeply understanding the engineering behind RAG-based chat systems. I’m using LangChain, Python, MongoDB, Qdrant vector DB, and more — focusing on clean architecture, readability, performance, and real-world reliability.

🚀 I enjoy shipping real products, working across the stack, and taking end-to-end ownership — from design through deployment.

🛠 Tech I like working with: Java, Python, SQL, distributed systems, cloud platforms (AWS, AZURE, GCP, OCI), and AI-powered apps.

🏃 Outside of work, I’m big on fitness and distance running — the consistency and discipline carry over into how I build software.
